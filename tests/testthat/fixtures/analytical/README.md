# Independent analytical reference fixtures

This bundle is a deterministic synthetic oracle for numerical analysis. It was
written independently of hyperannotatR and does not call a hyperannotatR writer, reader,
ROI constructor, or rasterizer when calculating expected results. The committed
files are sufficient for mandatory tests; regeneration requires Python 3 and
NumPy 2.5.3. Run `python3 generate.py` here, or pass an output directory as the
first argument. `MD5SUMS` supports portable base-R integrity checks and
`SHA256SUMS` provides a stronger external manifest.

The 4 by 5 by 3 float32 BIP ENVI cube uses the zero-based formula
`100*(band+1) + 10*(y+1) + x+1` and wavelengths 450, 550, and 650 nm. It has
literal NaN, +Inf, -Inf, and NaN samples at y/x/band positions 0/0/0, 1/2/1,
2/3/2, and 3/4/2. Rectangle A is `[0,3) x [0,3)` and rectangle B is
`[2,5) x [1,4)`. Each selects nine cells; the bitfield uses A=1 and B=2,
yielding 16 unique foreground cells, two overlap cells with value 3, and four
background cells. Unique-union band 1 has 15 finite samples, one invalid sample,
sum 1937, and mean 1937/15. Pooling ROI memberships would count 18 samples and
is a different estimand. `cube.npy` is provenance/interchange data only; no
floating NPY mask-reader capability is claimed.

The categorical masks use background=0, A=1, B=2 and absent=3. The remapped
prediction uses background=0, A=2, B=1 and absent=3, and must be aligned by label.
Literal row-major pairing gives confusion rows/reference and columns/prediction
`[[3,1,0],[0,3,1],[1,0,3]]`, accuracy 3/4, kappa 5/8, and A/B Dice 3/4 and IoU
3/5. Zero-union absent-class Dice/IoU are undefined. Bitfields use membership
bits A=1, B=2, absent=4; A Dice/IoU are 1, B Dice is 3/5, B IoU is 3/7, and
exact membership-set agreement is 2/3. Categorical kappa is not defined for
bitfield sets. A background-only Cohen denominator is zero, so kappa is
undefined rather than 1. Python's `Fraction` calculates the exact ratios.

The non-unit calibration case has level-0 dimensions 10 by 8, level-1
dimensions 4 by 2, and level-0 pixel size 0.5 by 3 micrometres. Its stored
level-1 rectangle is 2 by 1: geometric area is 2 at level 1 and 20 at level 0;
physical area is 30 square micrometres. Calibration level is explicit, and this
oracle does not infer calibration from ambiguous legacy ROI attributes or equate
geometric area with raster-selected pixel count.

All files here are newly authored synthetic data under the repository's
`MIT + file LICENSE` terms. They contain no acquired, patient, vendor, or other
third-party image data. `optional-formats.json` inventories the already-reviewed
synthetic OME-TIFF and SpecCube samples, their qualification limits, and the
absence of vendor/acquired whole-slide qualification. Existing reader, mask,
and QuPath fixture trees remain the authoritative format-specific fixtures.
