# Interoperability

![hyperannotatR logo](../reference/figures/logo.png)

Annotations are only useful if they can leave the tool that made them.
hyperannotatR stores every region of interest as a validated
simple-feature geometry in image pixel coordinates, with an explicit
pyramid level attached, which makes it straightforward to hand work off
to a viewer such as QuPath, to a GIS-flavoured GeoJSON consumer, or to a
Python segmentation pipeline, and to take the results back again.
Because the geometry model is the same one used internally, an export
followed by an import is a genuine round-trip rather than a lossy
approximation, and this vignette shows a live one for each format so you
can see that labels, identities, and coordinates survive intact.

A guiding principle runs through all four formats below: the coordinate
convention never changes silently. Coordinates are written in image
pixels unless you deliberately ask otherwise, so a polygon you exported
lands back on exactly the same pixels when you read it in.

We use the bundled example project throughout: three labelled rectangles
on a small tissue raster.

``` r

proj <- at_example_project()
at_rois(proj)[, c("roi_id", "layer", "label", "geom_type", "area_px")]
#> # A tibble: 3 × 5
#>   roi_id        layer   label    geom_type area_px
#>   <chr>         <chr>   <chr>    <chr>       <dbl>
#> 1 roi_000000001 regions tumour   POLYGON     19600
#> 2 roi_000000002 regions necrosis POLYGON     72704
#> 3 roi_000000003 regions stroma   POLYGON     34200
```

## GeoJSON

[`at_write_geojson()`](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/at_write_geojson.md)
serialises a project to a standard `FeatureCollection`. Each ROI becomes
one `Feature` whose `geometry` is the pixel-coordinate polygon and whose
`properties` carry the full hyperannotatR schema: `roi_id`, `layer`,
`label`, `level`, `author`, `created`, `modified`, `source`, the writing
`annotatR_version`, and any free-form `attributes`. Keeping the schema
explicit is what lets a file survive a return trip.

``` r

gj <- tempfile(fileext = ".geojson")
at_write_geojson(proj, gj)
cat(readLines(gj)[1:22], sep = "\n")
#> {
#>   "type": "FeatureCollection",
#>   "features": [
#>     {
#>       "type": "Feature",
#>       "id": "roi_000000001",
#>       "geometry": {
#>         "type": "Polygon",
#>         "coordinates": [
#>           [
#>             [120, 150],
#>             [260, 150],
#>             [260, 290],
#>             [120, 290],
#>             [120, 150]
#>           ]
#>         ]
#>       },
#>       "properties": {
#>         "roi_id": "roi_000000001",
#>         "layer": "regions",
#>         "label": "tumour",
```

The `roi_id` is preserved verbatim, so an ROI keeps its identity across
the boundary and you can join exported measurements back to the original
annotation. Reading the file back with
[`at_read_geojson()`](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/at_read_geojson.md)
reconstructs one `annot_layer` per distinct `layer` property. We rebuild
a project on the original image and check that the labels came through
intact.

``` r

back <- at_read_geojson(gj)
imported <- at_project(proj$image, back[["regions"]])
identical(sort(at_rois(proj)$label), sort(at_rois(imported)$label))
#> [1] TRUE
```

### The `flip_y` option

hyperannotatR’s convention is image orientation: the origin is top-left
and *y* increases downward. Many GIS tools instead expect *y* to
increase upward. Set `flip_y = TRUE` to write coordinates in that upward
convention; the y-axis is mirrored about the image height. If you write
flipped, you must read flipped, supplying the same `height` so the
inversion is undone:

``` r

h <- at_dims(proj$image)[2]
gj_flip <- tempfile(fileext = ".geojson")
at_write_geojson(proj, gj_flip, flip_y = TRUE)
regained <- at_read_geojson(gj_flip, flip_y = TRUE, height = h)
identical(sort(at_rois(at_project(proj$image, regained[["regions"]]))$centroid_y),
          sort(at_rois(proj)$centroid_y))
#> [1] TRUE
```

Leave `flip_y` at its default `FALSE` when exchanging with other
image-coordinate tools (including QuPath and hyperannotatR itself);
reach for it only when a downstream consumer explicitly wants a
cartesian, bottom-left origin.

## QuPath

QuPath reads and writes its own GeoJSON dialect. By default
[`at_write_qupath()`](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/at_write_qupath.md)
writes the form QuPath 0.4 and later read natively, checked against a
real QuPath 0.7.0 installation: `objectType` (`annotation`, or
`detection` for mask-derived ROIs), a `classification` with its `name`
(or the `names` of a derived class such as `"Tumor: Positive"`) and an
`[r, g, b]` `color`, and `isLocked` for locked ROIs. QuPath silently
replaces feature ids that are not UUIDs, so each ROI gets a
deterministic UUID and hyperannotatR’s own id, layer, source and level
travel in `properties.metadata`.
[`at_read_qupath()`](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/at_read_qupath.md)
restores labels, colours and those ids, and keeps everything else QuPath
carries under `attributes$qupath`: object type, measurements with
explicit `NaN`/infinity states, image planes, cell nuclei, and a flag on
ellipses that QuPath exported as polygons. Features without a
classification are imported as `"unclassified"` rather than dropped.

``` r

qp <- tempfile(fileext = ".geojson")
at_write_qupath(proj, qp)
feature <- jsonlite::read_json(qp)$features[[1]]
str(feature$properties[c("objectType", "classification", "metadata")], max.level = 2)
#> List of 3
#>  $ objectType    : chr "annotation"
#>  $ classification:List of 2
#>   ..$ name : chr "tumour"
#>   ..$ color:List of 3
#>  $ metadata      :List of 4
#>   ..$ annotatr_roi_id: chr "roi_000000001"
#>   ..$ annotatr_layer : chr "regions"
#>   ..$ annotatr_source: chr "manual"
#>   ..$ annotatr_level : chr "0"
```

### The colour gotcha

Older QuPath versions, and hyperannotatR 0.1, stored a classification
colour as a **signed** 32-bit `colorRGB` integer packed as `0xFFRRGGBB`.
The `0xFF` alpha byte pushes most colours past `2^31`, so they wrap
around to negative values: the grey `#999999` serialises as `-6710887`.
hyperannotatR still reads that form and writes it with
`dialect = "legacy"`; the modular arithmetic is handled in both
directions. QuPath keeps a single colour per classification name, so
identical labels with different layer colours collapse to the first
colour it sees. Reading the file back recovers the hex colours onto the
layer style:

``` r

lyr <- at_read_qupath(qp)
lyr$style$colour
#>    tumour  necrosis    stroma 
#> "#999999" "#E69F00" "#56B4E9"
```

## Masks for Python

For pixel-level pipelines the exchange currency is a raster mask, not a
polygon.
[`at_write_mask()`](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/at_write_mask.md)
writes an integer TIFF alongside a self-describing `<path>.legend.json`
sidecar that records the mask type, level, dimensions, and one entry per
class (`value`, `label`, `layer`, `roi_id`, `n_px`, `colour`). The
sidecar is what turns an anonymous grid of integers into something a
downstream model can interpret without guessing which value meant which
class, and it travels with the raster so the mapping is never lost.

``` r

m <- at_mask(proj, type = "labelled")
#> Registered S3 method overwritten by 'stars':
#>   method                  from
#>   st_interpolate_aw.stars sf
mp <- tempfile(fileext = ".tiff")
at_write_mask(m, mp)
cat(readLines(paste0(mp, ".legend.json"))[1:14], sep = "\n")
#> {
#>   "annotatR_version": "0.2.0",
#>   "created": "2026-10-19T05:51:42+0000",
#>   "mask_type": "labelled",
#>   "level": 0,
#>   "dims": [512, 512],
#>   "source_project": "example",
#>   "legend": [
#>     {
#>       "value": 1,
#>       "label": "tumour",
#>       "layer": "regions",
#>       "roi_id": "roi_000000001",
#>       "n_px": 19600,
```

Here we used a `"labelled"` mask, where each ROI gets its own integer; a
`"binary"` mask collapses everything to foreground and background, and a
`"multiclass"` mask shares one integer per label. Whichever you choose,
the legend describes exactly what the pixels mean. On the Python side,
read the TIFF as an integer array and load the legend to map values back
to labels. This chunk is illustrative and is not run when the vignette
is built.

``` python
import json
import numpy as np
import tifffile

mask = tifffile.imread("mask.tiff")
with open("mask.tiff.legend.json") as f:
    legend = json.load(f)

labels = {e["value"]: e["label"] for e in legend["legend"]}
for value, label in labels.items():
    print(label, int(np.sum(mask == value)), "px")
```

## CSV and WKT

For spreadsheet users and pipelines that would rather not parse JSON,
[`at_write_rois_csv()`](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/at_write_rois_csv.md)
produces one row per ROI with the geometry in a Well-Known Text
`geometry` column, plus the metadata fields.
[`at_read_rois_csv()`](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/at_read_rois_csv.md)
parses any CSV with at least `label` and `geometry` columns back into a
layer.

``` r

csv <- tempfile(fileext = ".csv")
at_write_rois_csv(proj, csv)
lyr_csv <- at_read_rois_csv(csv, layer_name = "regions")
at_rois(at_project(proj$image, lyr_csv))[, c("label", "geom_type", "area_px")]
#> # A tibble: 3 × 3
#>   label    geom_type area_px
#>   <chr>    <chr>       <dbl>
#> 1 tumour   POLYGON     19600
#> 2 necrosis POLYGON     72704
#> 3 stroma   POLYGON     34200
```

Because WKT is understood by PostGIS, `sf`, Shapely, and most spatial
databases, the CSV is often the shortest path into a wider geospatial
stack.
