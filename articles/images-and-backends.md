# Images and backends

## A handle, not a pixel array

Whole-slide microscopy and hyperspectral cubes are routinely gigabytes
in size, so hyperannotatR never loads them wholesale. Reading an image
returns an `annot_image`: a lightweight, backend-agnostic *handle* that
carries the metadata you need to annotate — dimensions, pyramid levels,
bands, pixel size — together with a lazy accessor that fetches pixels
only when asked.

``` r

img <- at_example_image("tissue")
img
#> <annot_image> example_tissue.png
#> backend: "raster"  |  dtype: "uint8"
#> size: 512 x 512 px  |  levels: 1  |  bands: 3
#> pixel size: 1 x 1 px
dim(img)
#> [1] 512 512   3
```

The [`dim()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/dim.html) of a handle is
`c(width, height, bands)`. Printing it summarises the backend that
opened it, the data type, and the extent, but nothing above has touched
the pixels themselves. That is the point: you can inspect, transform and
plan annotations against a huge image on a modest machine, because the
handle is a few hundred bytes regardless of how large the underlying
file is.

A handle also exposes accessors for everything an annotation workflow
needs:
[`at_n_bands()`](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/at_n_bands.md)
and
[`at_bands()`](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/at_bands.md)
for the channels,
[`at_pixel_size()`](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/at_pixel_size.md)
for physical scale, and
[`at_meta()`](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/at_meta.md)
for backend-specific keys such as the source path and data type. Each
simply reads a field of the handle — no I/O is involved.

## Pyramid levels

Slide and multiplex formats store the same scene at several resolutions
— a pyramid. Level `0` is full resolution; each higher level is a
coarser overview. The multiplex example is a three-level pyramidal TIFF.

``` r

mx <- at_example_image("multiplex")
at_n_levels(mx)
#> [1] 3
at_is_pyramidal(mx)
#> [1] TRUE

levels <- 0:(at_n_levels(mx) - 1L)
data.frame(
  level  = levels,
  width  = vapply(levels, function(l) at_dims(mx, l)[1], integer(1)),
  height = vapply(levels, function(l) at_dims(mx, l)[2], integer(1))
)
#>   level width height
#> 1     0   512    512
#> 2     1   256    256
#> 3     2   128    128
```

Levels matter for two reasons. First, an overview lets you display and
navigate the whole image without reading full resolution. Second, an ROI
drawn on a coarse level records the `level` it was created at, so its
coordinates can be rescaled exactly to level 0 (see
[`at_roi_rescale()`](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/at_roi_rescale.md)
and
[`at_transform()`](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/at_transform.md)).
Every geometry in hyperannotatR is anchored to a pyramid level; the
coordinate convention is image pixels with the origin at the top-left
and `y` increasing downward.

## Backends

A *backend* is the reader for a particular family of formats. The
registry maps format names to four functions — read metadata, fetch a
tile, detect a file, and report whether its optional dependencies are
installed — so new formats can be added without touching core code.

``` r

at_backend_list()
#> # A tibble: 6 × 4
#>   name    description                                 extensions       available
#>   <chr>   <chr>                                       <chr>            <lgl>    
#> 1 cuvis   Cubert hyperspectral (cuvis.r)              cu3, cu3s        FALSE    
#> 2 envi    ENVI header + binary cube                   hdr, dat, img, … TRUE     
#> 3 ometiff OME-TIFF and qptiff (RBioFormats)           ome.tif, ome.ti… TRUE     
#> 4 raster  PNG, JPEG, and single-plane TIFF            png, jpg, jpeg,… TRUE     
#> 5 tiff    Pyramidal / multi-directory TIFF            tif, tiff        TRUE     
#> 6 tivita  Diaspective Vision Tivita (ENVI-compatible) dat, hdr         TRUE
```

The `available` column is evaluated lazily: a backend for a format whose
support package is absent still appears in the list but reads nothing
until you install the package. This keeps the package usable with a
minimal set of dependencies, and means a missing optional package never
breaks loading — only reading that particular format. When you call
[`at_read_image()`](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/at_read_image.md)
without naming a backend, the registry tries the available backends in
priority order and picks the first that recognises the file; more
specific readers are tried before general ones, so an OME-TIFF is not
claimed by the plain raster reader. You can always bypass detection by
passing `backend =` explicitly.

## The universal tile accessor

Whatever the backend, pixels come out through one function,
[`at_tile()`](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/at_tile.md),
and always as a three-dimensional `[y, x, band]` numeric array — even
for a single band. You choose the pyramid level, an optional pixel
window, and an optional subset of bands.

``` r

tile <- at_tile(mx, level = 0, xrange = c(1, 64), yrange = c(1, 64))
dim(tile)
#> [1] 64 64  4
```

Because the request is scoped, only that 64x64x4 block is read. To
display a cheap thumbnail of the whole image, read the coarsest level in
full:

``` r

overview <- at_tile(mx, level = 2)
dim(overview)
#> [1] 128 128   4

dim(at_tile(mx, level = 2, bands = 1))
#> [1] 128 128   1
```

Spectral cubes are handled by the very same accessor; their band
metadata simply carries wavelengths, which you can read back with the
image accessors.

``` r

cu <- at_example_image("cube")
at_is_spectral(cu)
#> [1] TRUE
head(at_bands(cu), 3)
#> # A tibble: 3 × 7
#>   index name   wavelength unit   fwhm order wavelength_status
#>   <int> <chr>       <dbl> <chr> <dbl> <int> <chr>            
#> 1     1 Band 1       450  nm       NA     1 ok               
#> 2     2 Band 2       462. nm       NA     2 ok               
#> 3     3 Band 3       473. nm       NA     3 ok
range(at_wavelengths(cu))
#> [1] 450 900
```

## Registering a custom backend

Adding support for a new format means supplying the four functions and
calling
[`at_backend_register()`](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/at_backend_register.md).
The `read_fn` returns an `annot_image` — a classed list of metadata plus
a `handle` for the accessor — and the `tile_fn` turns a request into a
`[y, x, band]` array. Here is a complete, self-contained backend for a
toy “constant image” format that stores only a size and a fill value,
and synthesises pixels on demand.

``` r

const_read <- function(path, ...) {
  spec <- readRDS(path)                 # list(width, height, bands, value)
  structure(
    list(
      source     = path,
      backend    = "const",
      dims       = c(spec$width, spec$height),
      n_levels   = 1L,
      level_dims = list(c(spec$width, spec$height)),
      n_bands    = spec$bands,
      band_names = paste0("Band ", seq_len(spec$bands)),
      pixel_size = c(1, 1),
      pixel_unit = "px",
      dtype      = "double",
      handle     = list(value = spec$value),   # no pixels, just the fill value
      meta       = list()
    ),
    class = "annot_image"
  )
}

const_tile <- function(img, level, xrange, yrange, bands) {
  nx <- xrange[2] - xrange[1] + 1L
  ny <- yrange[2] - yrange[1] + 1L
  nb <- if (is.null(bands)) img$n_bands else length(bands)
  array(img$handle$value, dim = c(ny, nx, nb))
}

at_backend_register(
  name         = "const",
  read_fn      = const_read,
  tile_fn      = const_tile,
  detect_fn    = function(path) grepl("\\.const$", path, ignore.case = TRUE),
  available_fn = function() TRUE,
  description  = "Constant-value demo backend",
  extensions   = "const"
)
```

The new backend now behaves like any other — it appears in the registry,
is auto-detected from the file, and serves tiles through
[`at_tile()`](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/at_tile.md).

``` r

path <- tempfile(fileext = ".const")
saveRDS(list(width = 64L, height = 48L, bands = 2L, value = 0.5), path)

cimg <- at_read_image(path)
cimg
#> <annot_image> file363f4fd40962.const
#> backend: "const"  |  dtype: "double"
#> size: 64 x 48 px  |  levels: 1  |  bands: 2
#> pixel size: 1 x 1 px
dim(at_tile(cimg, xrange = c(1, 8), yrange = c(1, 8)))
#> [1] 8 8 2
```

## Memory discipline

The lazy handle is not a convenience but a contract. Everything
downstream reads tile-wise:
[`at_extract()`](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/at_extract.md)
walks each ROI’s bounding box level by level, and
[`at_mask()`](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/at_mask.md)
rasterises within the region’s extent rather than the whole slide. By
requesting only the window and bands you need — as
[`at_tile()`](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/at_tile.md)
above does — you can annotate and extract from images far larger than
memory. A well-behaved backend honours the same discipline: its
`tile_fn` should fetch just the requested window, never the entire
level, so that the cost of a call scales with the tile rather than the
image. The `const` backend above is the extreme case — it holds no
pixels at all and synthesises each tile from a single value.

Next, see the *The annotation model* vignette to learn how ROIs, layers
and projects build on these image handles.
