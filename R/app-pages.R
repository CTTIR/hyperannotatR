      "**hyperannotatR** is an R toolkit and Shiny application for annotating
hyperspectral image cubes -- in particular TIVITA *SpecCube* data -- in several
independent semantic layers, and exporting those annotations as label masks and
vector geometry for downstream analysis and machine learning.

It reproduces, in R, the multi-layer region-of-interest workflow used to label
tissue in hyperspectral studies. A single cube can carry several overlapping
annotations at once:

- **anatomy** -- the structural / anatomical region,
- **state** -- the physiological or injury state (e.g. burn depth),
- **uncertain** -- areas you are unsure about,
- **artefact** -- blood, instruments, drape and other non-tissue.

Because these layers overlap freely, you can capture a wound region, the
**penumbra ring** around an injury, and blood artefacts on top of tissue as
distinct annotations of the same image.

Every cube is shown as a natural-colour RGB rendered from its visible bands, and
every region maps directly onto the cube grid -- so per-region **spectra are
extracted from the original hyperspectral data**, not from the display image.

### 1. Data
Load a folder of images or cubes, or start from the queue already configured for
the session. The table lists every image and its status. Loading a new folder
retains the previous queue and its unsaved annotations. Use **Restore previous
queue** to recover it, and save it before closing the app. Paths are read on the
machine running R; the app is meant for local use.

### 2. Annotate
Three columns: the **queue** (left), the **canvas and tools** (middle), and
**layers & labels** (right).

- **Tools:** pan, rectangle, polygon, freehand, circle, point, edit (drag a
  region), erase (click a region to remove it), reflection wand, probe and select. **Undo**,
  **Redo** and **Copy previous** (the previous image's regions) sit next to them.
- Pick a **layer** (anatomy / state / uncertain / artefact) -- the label list
  updates to that layer's vocabulary. Add your own layers and labels with the
  fields beneath each list.
- Draw a region and it joins the **active layer** with the **active label**.
  Overlapping regions are expected and fine.
- **Point:** choose a small, medium or large display marker. It remains a
  single pixel in analytical masks. **Round area:** choose a 5, 10 or 20 image
  pixel diameter and click its centre, or choose *Drag to size*.
- **Reflection wand:** select a reflection label and click a bright highlight.
  Inspect the dashed proposal, then **Accept reflection** or **Discard** it.
  Tight/normal/broad controls connected-region growth. Pale tissue can also
  appear bright; this tool suggests an outline, not a tissue diagnosis.
  It supports image displays up to 2048 pixels per side.
- Annotations autosave when enabled for the session. Otherwise press **Save**.
  The badge next to Save shows the state (*unsaved*, *saved*, *staged*,
  *committed*, *read-only*), followed by the time of the last checkpoint and its
  folder; a warning appears when that folder is temporary and deleted when R
  exits. **Complete** saves before marking the entry complete; **Shift+Enter**
  also advances after a successful save. Reloading the page continues from the
  latest edits.
- Tab to the canvas. Arrows move the cursor (Shift: 10 pixels); Enter or Space
  places point/rectangle anchors. Space adds polygon vertices and Enter finishes.
  Escape cancels unfinished geometry. Shortcuts leave focused form controls their
  native behavior.
- The canvas shows an image overview with pan/zoom, not streamed pyramid tiles.
  It reports missing display capabilities and decoding failures before editing.
  Locked layers and protected ROIs cannot be changed in the app. Hidden layers
  remain included in analytical masks and exports.
- Press **?** (or the *? shortcuts* button) for the full keyboard-shortcut list:
  `n`/`p` to move between images, `q w e r t y` for tools, `1`-`9` for labels,
  `Ctrl+Z` to undo, `Shift+Enter` to complete and advance.

- For spectral cubes, the **Cube** panel switches the display between
  natural colour, a single band, a pseudo-RGB / false-colour triple and the
  registered band operations (ratio, normalised difference, band means). These
  are display products only; masks, spectra and exports always use the
  original cube values.
- The **probe** tool picks a pixel for its spectrum; **select** highlights an
  ROI. Changes proposed by a partner (for example qupflowR) appear as a
  **staged** patch that you commit or discard; the status badge shows
  *read-only*, *unsaved*, *staged* or *committed*.

### 3. Summary
Preview the derived **mask** (binary / labelled / multiclass, with an overlap
policy), read the **spectra** of a pixel, ROI or layer with their unit and
calibration state, and inspect or delete individual regions in the ROI table.

### 4. Export
Choose the **formats** (mask TIFF, GeoJSON, QuPath GeoJSON, ROI CSV) and a
**scope** (current / complete / all / flagged), then **Export & download** to get
a `.zip`. A copy is also written to the session's export folder. A **qupflowR
handoff** writes the neutral, hash-inventoried directory the partner package
imports."
