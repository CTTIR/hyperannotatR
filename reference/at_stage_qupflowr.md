# Stage partner changes against a hyperannotatR project

Compute, without applying, the changes a partner patch would make to an
hyperannotatR project: ROIs are joined by id and classified as `create`,
`update`, `unchanged`, `delete` (only with `delete_missing = TRUE`) or
`conflict`. Reviewed or locked ROIs, and ROIs in locked layers, are
never changed automatically, and nothing is created in or moved into a
locked layer; such changes become conflicts. Incoming ROIs whose id was
minted on import (features without an id) are always created, with an id
unique in the project. Incoming ROIs at another pyramid level are
compared, and updates stored, at the level of the existing ROI. A patch
that repeats an ROI id aborts (`DUPLICATE_ID`). When `expected_revision`
is given and the project has moved on, staging aborts with an
`at_conflict_error` (`REVISION_CONFLICT`).

## Usage

``` r
at_stage_qupflowr(
  x,
  patch,
  expected_revision = NULL,
  delete_missing = FALSE,
  call = rlang::caller_env()
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  An
  [annot_project](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/hyperannotatR-classes.md),
  or the path of a saved project `.rds` (then the commit re-reads and
  re-checks that file).

- patch:

  An import report from
  [`at_import_qupflowr()`](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/at_import_qupflowr.md),
  a handoff directory, or one or more
  [annot_layer](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/hyperannotatR-classes.md)
  objects.

- expected_revision:

  Optional revision of `x` the partner based its patch on (see
  [`at_annotation_revision()`](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/at_annotation_revision.md)).

- delete_missing:

  Logical; treat ROIs absent from the patch's layers as deletions.
  Default `FALSE`.

- call:

  The calling environment, for error reporting.

## Value

An `at_staged_patch`: a list with `patch_id`, `state = "staged"`,
`created`, `base_revision`, `proposed_revision`, `operations` (tibble of
`op`, `roi_id`, `layer`, `label`, `reason`), `summary` (counts by `op`),
`base`, `proposed` (the would-be project), `target_path` and
`patch_digest`.
