# Import model predictions as staged annotations

Convert an integer prediction mask into ROIs and stage them against a
project; nothing is committed. The prediction must match the image
dimensions at `level`, contain only integers, and every non-background
value must be in `label_map`; otherwise the import aborts. Optional
per-pixel confidence below `min_confidence` is set to background first.
Model and prediction digests and the confidence policy are recorded on
every ROI, which starts as `review_status = "unreviewed"`. Reviewed or
locked annotations are never overwritten: with `replace = TRUE` they
become staged conflicts.

## Usage

``` r
at_training_import(
  x,
  predictions,
  label_map,
  level = 0L,
  source = "dnn_prediction",
  model = list(name = NA_character_, version = NA_character_, sha256 = NA_character_),
  confidence = NULL,
  min_confidence = NULL,
  layer = "predictions",
  replace = FALSE,
  stage = TRUE,
  call = rlang::caller_env()
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  An
  [annot_project](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/hyperannotatR-classes.md).

- predictions:

  A mask file (TIFF/PNG/NPY), an `annot_mask`, or an integer matrix
  `[y, x]`.

- label_map:

  Named integer vector `label = code` (codes \>= 1; 0 is background).

- level:

  Pyramid level of the prediction grid.

- source:

  ROI source string. Default `"dnn_prediction"`.

- model:

  List with `name`, `version` and `sha256` of the model.

- confidence:

  Optional numeric matrix of per-pixel confidence.

- min_confidence:

  Optional threshold applied to `confidence` (which is then required).

- layer:

  Target layer name. Default `"predictions"`.

- replace:

  Logical; stage removal of existing unreviewed ROIs of `layer` not
  present in the prediction.

- stage:

  Logical; return an `at_staged_patch` (default) or, with `FALSE`, the
  prediction layer only.

- call:

  The calling environment, for error reporting.

## Value

An `at_staged_patch` (or an
[annot_layer](https://cttir.github.io/hyperannotatR/reference/hyperannotatR-classes.md)
when `stage = FALSE`) with attribute `prediction_digest`.
